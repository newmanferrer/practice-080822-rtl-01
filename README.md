# PRACTICE: REACT TESTING LIBRARY No. 1

## Project description

The main objective of this project is to improve skills related to testing, always taking the front end as a priority.

In this case and taking into account our priority, I have chosen to use React Testing Library, Since as its documentation says so "The core library has been wrapped to provide ergonomic APIs for several frameworks, including React, Angular, and Vue. There is also a plugin to use testing-library queries for end-to-end tests in Cypress and an implementation for React Native", this allows us to use this solution with the most used frameworks today.

Another important aspect is that with React Testing Library we can focus on tests from the perspective of the end user, that is, how the user interacts with our application, this seems very interesting to me.

For this initial practice I will try to follow the official documentation that RTL offers us.

Below are the points and topics that we will study and test in this first part.

- API

  - render
    - container
    - baseElement
    - queries
    - debug
    - rerender
    - unmount
  - cleanup
  - act

- QUERIES (Priority).

  - ByRole
  - ByLabelText
  - ByPlaceholderText
  - ByText
  - ByDisplayValue
  - ByAltText
  - ByTitle
  - ByTestId

- USER ACTIONS.

  - Firing Events
  - Async Methods
  - Appearance and Disappearance
  - Considerations for fireEvent
  - Using Fake Timers

- USER INTERACTIOS
  - user-event

I hope that this information, as well as me, can also be useful for other people interested in testing their applications.

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/newmanferrer/practice-080822-rtl-01.git
2. Another option is to download the repository using ZIP format.
3. Install the dependencies using the command "yarn", from the terminal console.
4. From the terminal console, execute the “yarn dev” command, to run the development server.
5. To run the tests, in the console run the command "yarn test".

## Important Notes, Suggestions and Recommendations

It is extremely important that we carry out tests on our code and applications on the front end side, no matter what technology we use, if we want to improve our code and make it more secure and reliable, we must implement tests that ensure a high percentage that we are doing things right.

The tests allow us to better understand the business logic and therefore make our code more intelligent and optimized.
